# Java
(Java version 7 or 8 is recommended, although PSL often works on newer versions).

# Git Repository
Git has a feature for cloning repositories.

Clone the several PSL examples inside repository.

git clone https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples.git

Or get the ZIP file from off of the GitHub page.

# Running a Basic Example
Go to a basic example, like the simple-acquaintances directory:

cd into psl-examples/simple-acquaintances/cli.

Each such example includes such a run.sh script that handles specific dependencies.

./run.sh

This fetches the PSL jar automatically.

Modify PSL versions that are located at the top of run.sh, if adjustment is needed.

Following running, inferred predicate values show in that inferred-predicates folder (for example, KNOWS.txt).

Various evaluation metrics appear in the console (accuracy, F1, and so on).

# Model File (.psl)
Contains within it logical rules, each with weights. Example snippet:

20: Lived(P1, L) & Lived(P2, L) & (P1 != P2) -> Knows(P1, P2) to the power of 2

# Data File (.data)
Defines open vs. Limited predicates with references toward specific data files.

Lists many observations, targets, and ground truth for evaluation.

Adjust rules with custom predicates, or point toward data files.

For more advanced usage, consult the PSL Documentation.
